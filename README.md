# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

I want to build a website and app that has 11 questions on it that you answer daily. Once answered it saves the results with a time and date stamp and shares them with other members of the site that are part of your group. it also has the option to send them to individual emails and text their phone.

Things that must be on the website and app:
Must be a full-stack app.
The homepage has 11 questions with boxes to answer them. These can be answered without logging in with the option to copy all 11 questions with their answers.
The same homepage for users that are logged in but with additional functionality that can send their answers to their friends with just a click through email, text, or an internal text system.
Time and date stamps are attached to all 11 questions and answers.
Login for users.
Ability to make groups with other users.
Ability to have friends.
Ability to block users.
A separate page that shares recent answers to all 11 questions anonymously that people can reply to anonymously.
Have the option for each user to display their phone number and email.
A page for each user that can edit their profile and a toggle to make you anonymous to all other users.
backend server to store data
The 11 questions:
When we retire at night we constructively review our day. Was I resentful today? (Check box with yes or no.)
Was I selfish today? (Check box with yes or no.)
Was I dishonest today? (Check box with yes or no.)
Was I afraid? (Check box with yes or no.)
Do I owe an apology? (Check box with yes or no.)
Have I kept something to myself which should be discussed with another person at once? (Check box with yes or no.)
Was I kind and loving toward all? (Check box with yes or no.)
What could I have done better?
Was I thinking of myself most of the time?
Did I think of what I could do for others?
What could I pack into the stream of life?
